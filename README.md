🚀 EduPong – Learn Smarter, Not Harder

A fast-paced Pong game fused with instant learning.

EduPong is not just another student project…
It’s an experiment in turning distraction into a learning tool.

Created by a first-semester engineering students, EduPong mixes the excitement of Pong with quick General Knowledge questions.
Every time you miss the ball, you don’t just lose a point — you face a question.
Answer correctly → You save your point.
Answer wrong → You lose one, and your opponent gains it.

This simple twist transforms gameplay into a micro-learning loop that keeps the brain alert, reduces stress, and makes memorizing facts surprisingly fun.

🎮 Why EduPong?

Traditional studying forces you to focus.
EduPong does the opposite:

It lets you get distracted — and then uses that distraction to teach you something.
Children especially benefit from this:
Short attention spans
Need for instant feedback
Learning better through play
EduPong merges gameplay + memory reinforcement into one addictive loop.
